# * SIMULATIONS ID: CHARACTERS 12-13 *
# ************************************
# The table below defines the meaning of characters 12-13 in the alphanumeric
# identification code, of the simulations already performed in the frame of the
# AdriaClim INTERREG IT-HR project, by ARPA FVG (PP11).
# It is worth to remind that characters 12-13 are reserved to the identification
# number of the type of initial and boundary conditions, and forcing.
# To know how to use this table, read the README file belonging to this
# directory.
