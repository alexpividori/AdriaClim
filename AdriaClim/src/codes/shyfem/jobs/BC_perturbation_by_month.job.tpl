#  DESCRIPTION:    this job template is aimed at processing FEM (.fem) files
#                  containing not perturbed boundary conditions for sea
#                  temperature, salinity and water level (see the EXTERNAL
#                  FILES comment section), by summing - for each month - an
#                  addend to each field, which is field- and month-specific
#                  (that is, for each month - 01, 02, ..., 12 - and for each
#                  field - T, S and Z - a "delta" is provided). "Deltas"
#                  (addends) are retrieved in an ASCII file (see the EXTERNAL
#                  FILES comment section).
#
#  EXTERNAL CALLS: - "sumelab" SHYFEM's intrinsic routine: tool of SHYFEM
#                    model, aimed at processing FEM (.fem) files. This routine
#                    is not part of the SHYFEM distribution, but has been
#                    developed by Alessandro Minigher (Arpa FVG), in
#                    analogy with the "femelab" SHYFEM's intrinsic tool.
#                    ("sumelab" and "femelab" are identical, except when used
#                    with the "-facts" option; the former sums addends to data,
#                    while the latter multiplies data by factors).
#
#  EXTERNAL FILES: - input FEM (.fem) files containing not perturbed boundary
#                    conditions for sea temperature, salinity and water level;
#                  - ASCII file containing water level, salinity and sea
#                    temperature's monthly "deltas" (variations with respect to
#                    a reference), for a certain scenario, decade, geographic
#                    point and statistical estimator (mean or median). This
#                    file is characterized by metadata (lines starting with the
#                    "#" character) and it is arranged in 4 columns, as shown
#                    below (missing values are identified as 1+e20):
#
#                    # Some lines of metadata
#                    # Month;delta T [Â°C];delta S [PSU];delta z [m]
#                    01;deltaT_01;deltaS_01;deltaZ_01
#                    02;deltaT_02;deltaS_02;deltaZ_02
#                    ...
#                    12;deltaT_12;deltaS_12;deltaZ_12
#
#                  - output FEM (.fem) files containing perturbed boundary
#                    conditions for sea temperature, salinity and water level,
#                    obtained from the not perturbed ones by the addition of
#                    "deltas".
