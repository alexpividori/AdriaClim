This directory is considered a sort of "database" for the "extra" (EXT) nodes
(*) to be considered in the frame of AdriaClim INTERREG IT-HR project's
simulations, performed by ARPA FVG (PP11).

(*) EXT nodes are specific nodes of the computational mesh, for which model
    outputs are provided with higher frequency.

The role of all the files, which are stored in this directory, can be
understood first by reading this README file and then by reading the header of
each of them.

This README file is arranged in one Section only (CLASSIFICATION OF EXT NODES),
the reading of which is mandatory, if it has not already been addressed before:


+-----------------------------+
| CLASSIFICATION OF EXT NODES +
+-----------------------------+

All the EXT nodes considered by ARPA FVG (PP11, AdriaClim INTERREG IT-HR
project) are classified according to an alphanumeric identification code,
composed by 5 characters.

The classification used to identify all the EXT nodes considered by ARPA FVG,
in the frame of the AdriaClim INTERREG IT-HR project, is defined as follows:

  - each EXT node is identified by an alphanumeric code, composed by 5
    characters (see the "main_table.csv" file belonging to this directory);
  - the alphanumeric code is divided in 3 parts, the first (see the
    "char_01_table.csv" file) and the second (see the "char_02_table.csv" file)
    composed by 1 character, while the third composed by 3 characters;
  - the first and second part of the alphanumeric code are composed by letters
    only, i.e. each character can be an element of the following set: {A, B, C,
    D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, Y, Z};
  - the third part of the alphanumeric code is composed by numbers only, in
    decimal base, i.e. each character can be an element of the following set:
    {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
  - the first part of the alphanumeric code identifies the general location of
    the EXT node (C = node near the coast; L = node in the lagoon or in one of
    its mouths; M = node in the open sea; C = node near the coast; S = nearest
    node to an ARPA FVG's measurement station or buoy);
  - the second part of the alphanumeric code identifies the relevance of the
    location of the EXT node (B = node in a bathing site or near a bathing
    site; F = node near a river mouth or delta; G = nearest node to a buoy;
    N = node in a nature reserve or near a nature reserve; P = node in an
    harbor or bay, but not in a bathing site; X = node in a location of no
    particular relevance);
  - the third part of the alphanumeric code identifies the progressive number
    (starting from 001) of the EXT node, with respect to the class defined by
    the first part of the alphanumeric code.


The list of all the EXT nodes to be considered in the frame of AdriaClim
INTERREG IT-HR project's simulations, performed by ARPA FVG (PP11), can be
retrieved in the "list_of_EXT_nodes.csv" file, belonging to this directory.
