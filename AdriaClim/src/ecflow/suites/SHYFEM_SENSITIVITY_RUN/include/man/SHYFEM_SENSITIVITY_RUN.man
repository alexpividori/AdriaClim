GOAL OF THE SUITE
Prepare, run, monitor and store a specific SHYFEM model's simulation or
sensitivity test, first carrying out the spin-up part and then performing the
actual one (spin-up free) through the use of the "restart" technique. Only the
actual part of the simulation (spin-up free) is archived.

DESCRIPTION OF THE SUITE
The suite is composed by a main family ("SIM_1"), which is dedicated to a
specific simulation. This family can be easily duplicated as many times as you
want (e.g. "SIM_2", "SIM_3", etc.), in order to simultaneously run multiple
different simulations.
The main family is composed by two main subfamilies ("SIM" triggered by the
completeness of "SPINUP"), which in turn are composed by the following
subfamilies, the description of which explains the aim of the suite itself:

 A) "SPINUP"
     1) "sentinel" -> this is the family for checking if there is consistency
                      in the identification code of the simulation to be run
                      ("t_check_sim_id_consist" task) and if this
                      identification code was already attributed to another
                      simulation before ("t_check_sim_id" task);
     2) "mkdirs"   -> this is the family for creating the "scratch" directory
                      and related subdirectories, dedicated to the simulation
                      to be run ("t_mkdirs" task). The tree of the main
                      directory is the following:
                       .
                       ├── EXT
                       ├── input
                       │   ├── adri
                       │   ├── meteo
                       │   └── rivers
                       └── NetCDF
     3) "mkinputs" -> this is the family for perturbing open sea boundary
                      conditions ("t_mkBCs" task) and meteorological forcing
                      ("t_perturb_meteo" task) by the addition of "deltas",
                      namely monthly mean or median variations predicted by a
                      certain model scenario for a certain decade, with respect
                      to a reference decade, and for a certain geographic
                      point.
                      Moreover, this is the family for linking all the input
                      files (settings, grid/basin, data) needed by SHYFEM to
                      run the simulation, to the desired directories
                      ("t_mklinks" task), and for creating the STR file,
                      starting from its related template ("t_mkSTRfile" task);
     4) "run"      -> this is the family for running SHYFEM ("t_run_shyfem"
                      task), marking its start ("t_run_status_0" task) and end
                      ("t_run_status_1" task);
     5) "spy"      -> this is the family for monitoring the evolution of the
                      simulation, by considering INF ("INF" family) and EXT
                      ("EXT" family) files, and by publishing monitoring
                      results on a dedicated web page ("html" family).
                      Specifically, at almost regular time intervals, the last
                      lines of the INF file are printed ("t_tail_INF_file"
                      task). Moreover, the time series of minimum and maximum
                      temperature and salinity of the whole basin are plotted,
                      from the start of the simulation onwards
                      ("t_INF_TS_min_max_plot" task). Furthermore, for some EXT
                      nodes, the time series of vertically averaged temperature
                      and salinity, and water level, are plotted, from the
                      start of the simulation onwards ("t_EXT_split_and_plot"
                      task). All these products appear on a dedicated web page
                      (*) while the simulation is running ("t_mkhtml_sim"
                      task), and disappear as soon as the simulation completes
                      ("t_rmhtml_sim" task).

 B) "SIM"
     1) "sentinel" -> this is the family for checking if there is consistency
                      in the identification code of the simulation to be run
                      ("t_check_sim_id_consist" task) and if this
                      identification code was already attributed to another
                      simulation before ("t_check_sim_id" task);
     2) "mkdirs"   -> this is the family for creating the "scratch" directory
                      and related subdirectories, dedicated to the simulation
                      to be run ("t_mkdirs" task). The tree of the main
                      directory is the following:
                       .
                       ├── EXT
                       ├── input

                       │   ├── meteo
                       │   └── rivers
                       └── NetCDF
     3) "mkinputs" -> this is the family for perturbing open sea boundary
                      conditions ("t_mkBCs" task) and meteorological forcing
                      ("t_perturb_meteo" task) by the addition of "deltas",
                      namely monthly mean or median variations predicted by a
                      certain model scenario for a certain decade, with respect
                      to a reference decade, and for a certain geographic
                      point.
                      Moreover, this is the family for linking all the input
                      files (settings, grid/basin, data) needed by SHYFEM to
                      run the simulation, to the desired directories
                      ("t_mklinks" task), and for creating the STR file,
                      starting from its related template ("t_mkSTRfile" task);
     4) "run"      -> this is the family for running SHYFEM ("t_run_shyfem"
                      task), marking its start ("t_run_status_0" task) and end
                      ("t_run_status_1" task);
     5) "spy"      -> this is the family for monitoring the evolution of the
                      simulation, by considering INF ("INF" family) and EXT
                      ("EXT" family) files, and by publishing monitoring
                      results on a dedicated web page ("html" family).
                      Specifically, at almost regular time intervals, the last
                      lines of the INF file are printed ("t_tail_INF_file"
                      task). Moreover, the time series of minimum and maximum
                      temperature and salinity of the whole basin are plotted,

                      ("t_INF_TS_min_max_plot" task). Furthermore, for some EXT
                      nodes, the time series of vertically averaged temperature
                      and salinity, and water level, are plotted, from the
                      start of the simulation onwards ("t_EXT_split_and_plot"
                      task). All these products appear on a dedicated web page
                      (*) while the simulation is running ("t_mkhtml_sim"
                      task), and disappear as soon as the simulation completes
                      ("t_rmhtml_sim" task);
     6) "postproc" -> this is the family for post-processing the outputs of the
                      simulation.
                      It is composed by the following subfamilies:
                      6a) "EXT"      -> this is the family for splitting
                                        (unpacking) the EXT file ("t_extsplit"
                                        task);
                      6b) "shy2nc"   -> this is the family for converting TS
                                        ("TS" family) and HYDRO ("HYDRO"
                                        family) files, from SHY to NetCDF
                                        ("t_shy2nc" task);
                      6c) "ncEXTsel" -> this is the family for selecting
                                        (extracting) NetCDF fields of T and S
                                        ("TS" family), and U, V and Z ("HYDRO"
                                        family), at the desired EXT nodes
                                        ("t_ncEXTsel" task);
     7) "clean"    -> this is the family for deleting all the files and
                      directories not to be stored ("t_clean" task);
     8) "archive"  -> this is the family for storing all the desired
                      information (files and directories) related to the spy
                      ("t_archive_spy" task) and simulation ("t_archive_sim"
                      task).

GUIDE FOR USERS
In order to be able to properly use this suite, follow the steps listed below:

 1) check the ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES in the DEFINITION SECTION of the suite's
    definition file ("%SUITE%.def") and edit them according to your environment
    or convenience;
 2) check the "SIM_ID" variable in the FAMILY SECTION of the suite's definition
    file ("%SUITE%.def") and edit it according to the identification code of
    the simulation you want to run;
 3) prepare the initialisation files peculiar to the simulation you want to
    run. Specifically, two files has to be prepared: one dedicated to the
    actual part (spin-up free) of the simulation, to be named as the
    identification code of simulation itself, plus the ".ini" extension (e.g.
    if "SIM_ID" was set to "1995F500A1_A001" -> "1995F500A1_A001.ini"), and the
    other dedicated to the spin-up part of the simulation, to be named as the
    identification code of simulation itself, plus the "-SPINUP" suffix and the
    ".ini" extension (e.g. if "SIM_ID" was set to "1995F500A1_A001" ->
    "1995F500A1_A001-SPINUP.ini").
    In order to do this, just copy a couple of these types of files, which
    should be already present in the "include/etc" subdirectory of the suite,
    and edit them according to your environment, convenience and features of
    the simulation you want to run, without changing the name of the variables.
    Please note that for each new simulation you want to run, there are the
    following sections of the initialisation files that must be edited
    (variables assignment):
     - SIMULATION'S ID ->    define the "SHY_SIM_ID" variable as the
                             identification code of the corresponding
                             simulation (e.g. SHY_SIM_ID="1995F100A1_A001" in
                             file "1995F100A1_A001.ini";
                             SHY_SIM_ID="1995F100A1_A001-SPINUP" in file
                             "1995F100A1_A001-SPINUP.ini");
     - STR FILE VARIABLES -> edit the content of all the variables
                             characterizing the simulation you want to run
                             (settings, input data, restart file, etc.).
    Moreover, there are the two following sections, which should (but not must)
    be edited (variables assignment):
     - TIME to SLEEP for the SPY -> define the "SPY_SLEEP_MIN" variable with
                                    respect to your desire and to the length of
                                    the simulation you want to run;
     - DIRECTIVES for PLOTTING   -> define the "EXT_NODES_2_PLOT" variable
                                    (array) according to your desire, making
                                    sure to consider available EXT nodes IDs,
                                    with respect to the simulation you want to
                                    run.
    Please note that the two initialisation files to be prepared for each
    simulation to be run have to be consistent with each other, remembering
    that the simulation is the same, but it is splitted in two parts for
    convenience (spin-up + spin-up free parts).
 4) load the suite (ecflow_client --load=%SUITE%.def);
 5) begin the suite (ecflow_client --begin=%SUITE%)
 6) in case you want to run N (>1) simulations simultaneously, copy the "SIM_1"
    family (FAMILY SECTION of the suite's definition file, "%SUITE%.def") below
    itself, N-1 times, renaming the new families properly (e.g. "SIM_2",
    "SIM_3", ..., "SIM_N") and following steps 1)-3).
    Afterwards, if the suite already began, replace all the new families (e.g.
    ecflow_client --replace=/%SUITE%/SIM_2 %SUITE%.def); otherwise, follow
    steps 4) and 5).

 WARNING! It is possible (very low probability) that when multiple simulations
          are run, the "t_mkhtml_sim.ecf" tasks overlap, causing not all the
          running simulations to appear on the web page. If it is the case,
          just requeue the "html" subfamily ("spy" family) of the not appearing
          simulations.

WHAT TO DO IN CASE OF FAILURES
In case of failures, follow the hints listed below:

 1) check which node generated the failure and try to remove the bug. All tasks
    of this suite should complete without failures.
    In many cases, you can re-queue the whole suite and the problem is solved;
 2) keep in mind to check the "ecFlow" log files and to save them before
    re-requeuing the suite, otherwise they will be overwritten.
    You can find log files in the suite's "ECF_HOME" subdirectory
    ("%ECF_HOME%%SUITE%").

 WARNING! If the absolute value of "deltas" is too high, SHYFEM - in the
          configuration adopted in the INTERREG IT-HR AdriaClim project - may
          crash with error messages that are not easy to interpret. Nothing can
          be done in this case. Please just be aware of this possibility.

GLOSSARY
Some key, or particular, words are listed in the following, together with their
brief description:

 - SHYFEM model          -> see https://sites.google.com/site/shyfem/home;
 - INF file              -> ASCII file, with ".inf" extension, generated by
                            SHYFEM while it is running. It is a log file, which
                            provides basic information on the evolution of the
                            run (e.g. minimum and maximum temperature and
                            salinity of the whole basin);
 - STR file              -> ASCII parameter input file, with ".str" extension,
                            needed to run SHYFEM. It guides SHYFEM's
                            performance and contains all the necessary
                            information for the main routine to execute the
                            model;
 - RST file              -> binary "restart" file, with ".rst" extension, of
                            SHYFEM's simulations;
 - SHY file              -> binary file, with ".shy" extension, storing
                            SHYFEM's simulations outputs;
 - TS file               -> SHY file storing temperature and salinity fields;
 - HYDRO file            -> SHY file storing the sea water velocity field;
 - EXT file              -> SHY file (actually with ".ext" extension) storing
                            fields provided with higher frequency, for all the
                            variables, but for EXT nodes only;
 - EXT node:             -> set of nodes of the computational mesh, specified
                            in the "$extra" section of SHYFEM's STR file, for
                            which simulations outputs are provided with higher
                            frequency;
 - EXT nodes ASCII files -> ASCII time series files, resulting from a splitted
                            (unpacked) EXT file, arranged in two or more
                            columns, the first containing date and time
                            (formatted as YYYY-MM-DD::hh:mm:ss), while the
                            others containing actual data, referred to a
                            specific vertical layer (2nd column -> layer 1, 3rd
                            column -> layer 2, etc.). For 2D variables, there
                            are only two columns and a reference layer can not
                            be specified (for the water level, the reference is
                            the sea surface). The basename of these files is of
                            the following type: "what.dim.node", where "what"
                            is the variable's abbreviation (e.g. "temp", "salt",
                            "velx", "vely", "zeta"), "dim" is the variable's
                            spatial dimension ("2d" or "3d") and "node" is
                            consecutive EXT node numbering (e.g. "1" for EXT
                            node 1, "2" for EXT node 2, etc.).
                            "2d" files are characterized by a top line of
                            metadata, starting with the "#" character, and are
                            arranged in two columns, the first containing date
                            and time (formatted as YYYY-MM-DD::hh:mm:ss) and
                            the second containing the 2D variable (or the
                            vertically averaged variable, in case of 3D ones);
 - "Deltas" file         -> ASCII file containing water level, salinity and sea
                            temperature's monthly "deltas" (variations with
                            respect to a reference), for a certain scenario,
                            decade, geographic point and statistical estimator
                            (mean or median). This file is characterized by
                            metadata (lines starting with the "#" character)
                            and it is arranged in 4 columns, as shown below
                            (missing values are identified as 1+e20):

                            # Some lines of metadata
                            # Month;delta T [°C];delta S [PSU];delta z [m]
                            01;deltaT_01;deltaS_01;deltaZ_01
                            02;deltaT_02;deltaS_02;deltaZ_02
                            ...
