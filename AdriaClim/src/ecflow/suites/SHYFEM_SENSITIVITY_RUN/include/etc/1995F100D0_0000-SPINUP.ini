#  DESCRIPTION:      this initialisation file is aimed at defining the
#                    environment of BASH scripts, run in the frame of "ecFlow"
#                    tasks.
#                    It is specific to the "spin-up simulation" to be run and
#                    must be named as the identification code of the actual
#                    simulation, plus the "-SPINUP" suffix and ".ini" extension
#                    (e.g. "1995F100A1_A001-SPINUP.ini").
#                    Moreover, it should be placed in the "include/etc"
#                    directory of the belonging suite.
#
#                    This initialisation file is characterized by the following
#                    sections:
#
#                     - SIMULATION'S ID;
#                     - TIME to SLEEP for the SPY;
#                     - SHYFEM'S VERSION;
#                     - ENVIRONMENTAL MODULES;
#                     - PATHS of DIRECTORIES;
#                     - STR FILE VARIABLES;

#                     - JOBS: ACTUAL SCRIPTS & TEMPLATES;
#                     - DIRECTIVES for PLOTTING.
#
#                    IMPORTANT! Please note that sections "SIMULATION'S ID" and
#                               "STR FILE VARIABLES" must be edited for each
#                               new simulation to be run.
#                               Moreover, the "TIME to SLEEP for the SPY"
#                               section should have to be edited with respect
#                               to the time length of the simulation.
#                               Furthermore, the "DIRECTIVES for PLOTTING"
#                               section should have to be edited in its
#                               "EXT_NODES_2_PLOT" variable.
#                               This file must be edited consistently with that
#                               dedicated to the actual part of the simulation
#                               (spin-up free).
