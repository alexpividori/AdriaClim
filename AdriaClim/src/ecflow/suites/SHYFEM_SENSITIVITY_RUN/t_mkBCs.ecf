#                                    TASK
#                   To be used in the frame of "ecFlow" suites
#            (https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/ECFLOW/ecflow+home)
# ******************************************************************************
#
#  DESCRIPTION:    this "ecFlow" task is aimed at processing FEM (.fem) files
#                  containing not perturbed boundary conditions for sea
#                  temperature, salinity and water level, by summing - for
#                  each month - an addend to each field, which is field- and
#                  month-specific (that is, for each month - 01, 02, ..., 12
#                  - and for each field - T, S and Z - a "delta" is provided).
#                  "Deltas" (addends) are retrieved in an ASCII file (see the
#                  EXTERNAL FILES comment section).
#                  Processing of boundary conditions is carried out by the use
#                  of a job, prepared from its related template, through a
#                  "sedfile" (see the EXTERNAL CALLS comment section).
#
#  EXTERNAL CALLS: - job template aimed at processing FEM (.fem) files
#                    containing not perturbed boundary conditions for sea
#                    temperature, salinity and water level, by summing - for
#                    each month - an addend to each field, which is field- and
#                    month-specific (that is, for each month - 01, 02, ..., 12
#                    - and for each field - T, S and Z - a "delta" is
#                    provided). "Deltas" (addends) are retrieved in an ASCII
#                    file (see the EXTERNAL FILES comment section).
#
#  EXTERNAL FILES: - header managing general calls to "ecFlow" client;
#                  - function managing the PBS queue job submission;
#                  - suite initialisation file, specific for a certain
#                    simulation;
#                  - ASCII file containing water level, salinity and sea
#                    temperature's monthly "deltas" (variations with respect to
#                    a reference), for a certain scenario, decade, geographic
#                    point and statistical estimator (mean or median). This
#                    file is characterized by metadata (lines starting with the
#                    "#" character) and it is arranged in 4 columns, as shown
#                    below:
#
#                    # Some lines of metadata
#                    # Month;delta T [Â°C];delta S [PSU];delta z [m]
#                    01;deltaT_01;deltaS_01;deltaZ_01
#                    02;deltaT_02;deltaS_02;deltaZ_02
#                    ...
#                    12;deltaT_12;deltaS_12;deltaZ_12
